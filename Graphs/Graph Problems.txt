DFS
{
    simple digraph problems:
        - reachability
        - path finding
        - topological sort
        - directed cycle detection
    
    difficult digraph problems:
        - 2-satisfiability
        - directed Euler path
        - stringly-connected components

BFS
{
    simple digraph problems:
        - shortest paths (fewest number of edges)
